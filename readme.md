## Possible improvements
- As of right now the sound of the space bar plays in the corridor whenever you push the button, even if you are not close to any objects with which you can interact.

- Different functions throuout the code are declared multiple times in each scene, for purposes of clarity it would be preferable to declare them once at the beginning of the code but any attempt at doing so has resultated in either errors or the dialogues simply not working

- During developement the addition of mini-games to access each teahcer was discussed. The mini-games would have helped the player to understand how K.A.T.E was built and how her problem solving skills could be applied to simple tasks.

- Drawing is, unfortunately, not a skill that the creators posses. While the vast majority of the drawings (all except that character player in the map scene) are original works, they would benefit from an artist's touch.

## **Tools used**
- This project was conducted using the kaboom library and Visual Studio Code.

- This project was a collaborative effort produced in-person and using Visual Studio Code's Live Share extension. Commit rates are therefore not representative of the overall work distribution as they were made by whomever hosted the Live Share during collaboration sessions. 

## Development context
This project was developed as part of the course "Jeu vid√©o 2D" (Spring 2022) taught by Isaac Pante (SLI, Lettres, UNIL)
